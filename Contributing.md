# Contributing
All help is greatly appreciated! This repo uses [Common-Flow](https://commonflow.org/)

## How can you contribute?
There are a couple of ways you can help out.
* [Issues](#Issues): If you happen to identify that something is broken or that a feature is missing then you can create an issue for it.
* [Pull Requests](#Pull-Requests): If you identify an issue or have a feature request and wish to write the code yourself then you can create a pull request.

## Issues
### Standard issues
Opening issues is very easy. Head to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/sk82jack/PSFPL/issues) and open one if it does not exist already.
### Bugs and errors
If you encounter any errors then please supply the following information:
1. The script or function that is causing the error.
2. The verbose and error output of the script! Either set `$VerbosePreference = 'Continue'` or use the verbose switch.

## Pull Requests
If you wish to fix an issue or write a feature that you would like included then here are some guidelines:
1. If there is an issue logged that you are fixing or a request that you are fulfilling then please comment on the issue to say you're working on it.
2. Fork the repository, create a new branch for your issue/feature and base your changes off of the 'master' branch.
3. Fix the issue or fulfill the request! You must also create pester tests for your contributions.
4. Make sure you have pushed your commits and then make a pull request to the master branch
5. Wait for the code review and - if all is good - the merge confirmation!
